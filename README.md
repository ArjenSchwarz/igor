# Igor

Igor is a Slack Slash command that acts like a bot. The code is written in Go and is designed to be run on AWS Lambda through a NodeJS wrapper or as a Docker container. All commands are handled through plugins, making it extendable.

The name is based on Sir Terry Pratchett's wonderful use of Dr. Frankenstein's servant. No disrespect intended.

Igor is currently early in development, and can't do much yet, but it is usable.

To make plugin development easier, there is a snippet for Sublime Text included in the devtools directory. If you copy this to your User package you can easily create the skeleton for a plugin with it.

You can also test your commands locally using `bin/testcommand.sh`. This script will read your config.yml file and based on that it will generate a correctly formatted json string and provide that to the binary.

For example:

```bash
$ bin/testcommand.sh "introduce yourself"
{"text":"I am Igor, reprethenting We-R-Igors.","response_type":"in_channel","attachments":[{"title":"A Spare Hand When Needed","text":"We come from Ãœberwald, but are alwayth where we are needed motht.\nRun */igor help* to see which Igors are currently available.","mrkdwn_in":["text"]}]}
```
